# ETL 

Analysts: Sarah Zachrich, Madison Chamberlain, Kevin Schram, Robin Bun, Andrew Marino

Data Type: Video game data based on Steam (a cloud-based gaming library)

Objective: In this project we found multiple sources (primaryily web scraping) to create tables/collections that were stored in a database. Once we have identified our datasets we must perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on the data to clean it up and make any necessary joins or filtering, etc... This data will then be loaded into a final database. 

Below shows the SQL data base we created:
